## Concurrency Bug Subjects (Java/C++) ##
This repository includes multi-threaded Java/C/C++ subjects with concurrency bugs. 

### Java Subjects ###
- **IBM Contest Benchmark Suite**: It is a collection of small Java programs (less than 1KLOC). You can download the original programs by contacting Shmuel Ur at IBM.
- **Java Collection Library**: Java Collection Libraries may crash when they are not appropriately used. This repository has the source code of Java 1.4 and test cases.
- This repository has other programs and test cases.
- You may get other large Java programs at the [CalFuzzer homepage](http://srl.cs.berkeley.edu/~ksen/calfuzzer/).
- You may get other large Java programs, such as Derby and Tomcat, at the [leap homepage](http://www.cse.ust.hk/prism/leap/).

### C/C++ Subjects ###
- **Toy Benchmark Programs**: This repository includes toy benchmark programs (less than 1KLOC), extracted from real bugs in mysql and mozilla. These programs are written by [Jie Yu](https://github.com/jieyu).
- You may get other large C/C++ programs, such as apache and mysql, [concurrency bug collection](https://github.com/jieyu/concurrency-bugs).
